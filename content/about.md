{{< about-social >}}

My name is Janosch Müller. I'm a software developer by trade.

Some fun facts about me:

* I've studied three liberal arts (and snuck into some actual science courses)
* I've done a bit of music journalism and interviewed Moby
* I've interned at a non-profit where we auctioned off a gold-plated toilet
