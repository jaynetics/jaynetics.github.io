About once a year or so I have an unusually vivid dream. Are these dreams actually different from other dreams? Or do I just wake up at an unusual moment?

In any case, these dreams stand out to me, and the visuals are often the most interesting bit. Everything appears crystal clear and detailed as I dream, and after getting up, the imagery is still very present in my mind.

In some cases, I've documented these rare dreams with a few sentences. To my surprise, it turned out that just a short summary is enough to restore the imagery in my mind much later â€“ even years later. After waiting long enough, the impression is quite akin to a memory, just more absurd.

I've also thought about trying to make sketches of these dreams, but it always seemed to be too much work. Could I do it with AI instead? It's been a while since I [gave image generation models a bigger test run](./feeding-song-lyrics-into-dall-e-3-midjourney-and-stable-diffusion/). So I decided to do another tour, trying to make them generate images that are as close to what I have in mind as possible.

## Dream about an adventure

### Prompt

> A monstrously large spider monster in a cave, preying on a metallic, quicksilver-like, weirdly shaped blob. The blob is stuck to the ceiling some way above. A friendly person looks in through the door crack of a thick, old, wooden door. The door is set in the cave wall.

### Background

This dream was probably inspired by a re-read of Lord of the Rings. I tried different prompts to get the metallic blob to look ever so slightly anthropomorphic, just as it was in my dream, but that would always mess up other parts of the image.

### Result

## Dream about feeling crushed

### Prompt

> An Asian woman sitting on a plain green bench without backrest. She is wearing rings with very large and colorful gemstones on her hands. Opposite of her, lying flatly on his back on another similar bench, a man is being crushed by a black box. The man holds a cornet with strawberry ice cream in his dangling hand.

### Background

This dream was about a girl who preferred another guy over me. They didn't end up exchanging rings tho. Ha-Ha!

## Dream about fucking up at school

### Prompt

> A pupil in the hallway of a school, surrounded by a few other pupils. His face shows that he has just realized there is a math exam today and he hasn't prepared for it.

### Background

I used to have this or similar dreams for years after I finished school. In many of these cases, I "realized" during the dream that I missed something important at school, and thus my higher education degrees would also be invalidated! I'd have to go back to
school to re-do the final school years, and somehow also juggle this task with my job and family life. Hence the facial expression in the image is hardly exaggerated ...

### Result

## Dream about an old man

### Prompt

> An old man in a grey and brown checkered suit, feeding ducks with popcorn from a trash bag.

### Background

Admittedly, this dream isn't that outlandish. Some whacko giving inappropriate food to a random type of bird? You know, if you've lived in Berlin for long enough, a scene like this may almost give you a fuzzy and homey feeling.

### Result

## Dream about dancing in the sky

### Prompt

> A man in black clothes flying through the evening sky and dancing ecstatically at the same time, even contorting himself. The sound of airflow is like a synthesizer pad. The landscape far below is passing by so rapidly that it's a bit blurry.

### Background

I had a high fever when I had this dream. The dream stood out for being quite synaesthetic and also including some very specific music. I tried to recreate that music in Fruity Loops at the time, but it took me too long and the sounds slipped through my fingers. If I ever have such a dream again, I'll try using something like [Suno](suno.com).

### Result

## Dream about Crete

### Prompt

> A long barren coastline of Crete, with steep cliffs and several white-washed, high-rising monasteries, and very high arches dispersed across it.

### Background

I've been to Crete a few times as a kid. There were more and taller arches in the dream, but any changes I made to the prompt made other bits worse, so I left it at this.

### Result

## Dream about misery

### Prompt

> The stairwell of a rundown prefabricated building. It is almost too dark to see anything. On an intermediate storey, there is an entrance to an elevator. The door is missing. Inside the elevator, there is a piece of burnt tinfoil on the ground, as well as a black Ghettoblaster. Both are just about visible in the dark. In the back of the elevator, there is a subtle shadow of a cowering dark figure.

### Background

I was probably processing the drug addicts of Berlin's streets in this one. (While this dream had a nightmarish touch, it's worth noting that the increase in foil smoking in recent years is arguably a good trend, as it is a lot less harmful to the addicts than syringes.)

### Result

## Dream about Darth Vader

### Prompt

> Darth Vader inhaling gummy bears through the grille of his helmet, profile view.

### Background

This dream was unusual in that I honestly had to chuckle when I woke up. There were gummy bears at the party the night before I dreamt this, which explains part of it. Where that Vader guy came from, I don't really have a clue.

### Result

## Conclusion

Do some of these look like what I saw in my dreams? Yes, somewhat! A few come quite close, which made it ever the more frustrating that I couldn't get the final 20% right. As you may have guessed, all these prompts went through a few iterations, and I tried each of them in three models. Yet in all of the cases, I hit a brick wall at some point.

I'm not saying this is the model's fault. Well, okay, in some cases it is. E.g., for the dream with the two green benches, I couldn't get the benches to stand opposite of each other and still preserve other aspects of the image, no matter which way I described it. It would have been way easier to explain this to a human artist. I'd probably just use my hands to demonstrate the spatial arrangement. Of course, in some cases, there might be a limit to gestures and language: Just because a highly specific image exists in someone's head, that doesn't mean there is an exact and unambiguous way to get it out of there. We're not pixel enumerators, after all, and I guess that's exactly why we can have all these multi-layered, absurd yet pretty experiences.

If I wanted these images to get really close to the "originals", I'd have to whip out photoshop and at the very least stitch together multiple generated images. So at this point, I'm not sure using AI beats sketching for this purpose. Sketching would probably win at authenticity, though of course generated images look nicer. Another thing I might try at some point is first making a sketch, and then augmenting it with AI.
